Q: Can I enter the United States with my unexpired student visa even if I have a new SEVIS ID number? A: The US Department of State (the government agency issuing visas) [Consulate Field Advisory Manual](https://fam.state.gov/FAM/09FAM/09FAM040205.html#M402_5_5_R_1) states that students should get a new visa. In practice, however, US Customs and Border Protection (the government agency you interact with when traveling into the US) has not indicated that this will be a problem and remains consistent in admitting students who are in this situation into the United States without issue.
