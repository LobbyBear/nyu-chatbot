Q: I am a visiting student and want to extend my I-20/DS-2019 to stay at NYU for another semester. Can I do that? A: It may be possible to extend your I-20/DS-2019 if you have received permission from your academic program to study at NYU for an additional semester. Please [contact OGS](https://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html) after you have received academic permission to learn more about the process to extend your I-20/DS-2019 depending on your program.
