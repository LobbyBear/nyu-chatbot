Q: Do I need a Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to file my tax forms? A: If you had no US source income, you do not need a SSN or ITIN to file the Form 8843. If you did have any US source income, you will need either a SSN or ITIN to file your tax forms. If filing with Sprintax, the software will provide you with instructions as to whether you need a SSN or ITIN.
