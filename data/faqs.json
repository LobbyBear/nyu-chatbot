        "answer": "Submit your application at least 3-4\u2028 months prior to your intended start date in case of visa delays.

        "answer": "OGS advises students to apply for a visa in their country of citizenship or residence as this is where an applicant can display strongest ties, hence a US consulate or embassy can best determine your non-immigrant intent. However, if you decide to apply for a visa outside of your country of citizenship or residence (as a third country national) then it is important to confirm that the US consulate or embassy in that location accepts F-1/J-1 visa applications from citizens of other countries. You will also want to consider the heightened cost, longer travel and processing times (that could include a quarantine requirement or administrative processing) and other associated risks. "

        "answer": "No, you do not need a US student visa in order to begin your studies remotely from outside of the United States. You will, however, need a student visa in order to get into the United States.

        "answer": "Unfortunately, you will have to wait until the embassy or consulate you intend to apply at resumes their services in order to go through your visa appointment. Keep checking on the website of the consulate or embassy you plan to apply at for the latest updates. Depending on your situation, you may be eligible for an emergency visa appointment. At many embassies, if you are a student or exchange visitor and your program will begin within 60 days when no regular appointments are available, you may be eligible. You must show them proof that your start date is within 60 days and you must not have had a visa denial within the last 6 months at the US Embassy or Consulate. The website of the embassy or consulate you will apply at will have the detailed information for that location. "

    {
        "question": "What happens if my visa is denied?",
        "answer": "If you receive a visa denial, request a denial letter from the US Consulate so that you will understand why your visa was denied. The main reason visas are denied for the US is failure of the applicant to prove they have ties to their home country.

        "question": "Can I enter the US as a tourist and then change to F-1 status if I already have a valid tourist visa?",
        "answer": "No. You must enter the United States in F-1 or J-1 student status. If you happen to have a valid tourist visa and try to enter the United States as a tourist, you will immediately be in violation of your tourist status if you are enrolled in a full course of study. Therefore, you must wait until you have a valid student visa (unless you\u2019re a Canadian citizen) to enter the United States to begin your program of study. "

        "answer": "<a id=\"newstudentfaqvisa\"></a>The US Department of State (the government agency issuing visas)\u00a0Consulate Field Advisory Manual states that students should get a new visa. In practice, however, US Customs and Border Protection (the government agency you interact with when traveling into the US) has not indicated that this will be a problem and remains consistent in admitting students who are in this situation into the United States without issue.

        "question": "Can I work remotely while on CPT?",
        "answer": "Generally speaking, remote work is a possibility, but it depends on where you are physically working from, and where your company is physically based. CPT is designed for students to work for a US-based company while students are physically located in the US. If you are pursuing remote work while you are in the US with a US-based employer, you should have evidence for your personal immigration records that you are receiving direct, regular, and appropriate supervision for your training in your experiential opportunity. For more details and guidance on this matter, it would be best to [speak with an OGS advisor at length about your individual situation](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html). "
    },
    {
        "question": "When should I apply? How long does the application take?",
        "answer": "You can start applying for your OPT 90 days before either your proposed employment start date if you are applying for [pre-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PreCompletionOPT.html) or 90 days before your program completion date if you are applying for [post-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PostCompletionOPT.html). You will first need to apply for your OPT I-20 with OGS which can take up to two weeks. OGS handles all NYU OPT applications and works as fast as possible to issue OPT I-20s. If your I-20 is ready before the 2 weeks processing time, we will let you know. Once you apply for the EAD with the US government it can take approximately up to 3.5 months time to process your application. Check the [US government processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/). [You must select \"I-765\" for form type. For Field Office or Service Center, most of our students' applications go to the Potomac Service Center.] For December graduates, that means you should apply by mid September; for May graduates, by mid February. By applying early, you can avoid the risks that come from an OPT request being denied after the grace period has ended. In addition, delaying your application will not allow you to stay longer in the US. Students can choose to file for [premium processing](https://www.uscis.gov/i-907) and follow the instructions on the USCIS website. "
    },
    {
        "question": "I'm in my last semester and have applied for OPT. Can I be outside the US while it's pending? Is there anything else I should know?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can be outside of the US while your OPT application is pending with USCIS, but there are always risks associated with this. First, we recommend that you have someone you know and trust monitor your mail in the US if you choose to travel. If you receive any correspondence from USCIS while your OPT application is pending, you need to know what they have sent you. On occasion students receive requests for further information/evidence (also known as an \u201cRFE\u201d) from USCIS regarding their application. You must reply to USCIS within a specified period of time if you receive an RFE. If you do not reply to them by their specified deadline, your application would then be at risk for being denied. If the denial occurs when you are outside of the US, then you would be unable to reapply for OPT until and unless you enter back into the US in F-1 status. Additionally, if you are outside of the US after you complete your program but do not have all of the [required travel documents for while you are on OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/documents-to-carry.html), you may face difficulties in reentering the US. Because international travel and restrictions are unpredictable during this time, even if you plan to travel back to the US before your program ends, you may not be able to do so. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there an option to expedite the processing of my OPT application?",
        "answer": "[Current processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) are always posted by USCIS. You can check what the current processing time is by clicking on the link, selecting \"I-765 for Employment Authorization\" for the Form field, \"Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]\" for the Form Category field, and \"Potomac Service Center\" for the Field Office or Service Center field. It is best to plan ahead and apply as early as possible because the US government rarely expedites applications (see [USCIS expedite criteria](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria)) unless you pay an extra cost for premium processing. Please note, there is a significant fee for premium processing (in addition to the OPT application fee). Full details on how to request premium (or expedited) processing is on the USCIS webpage for the [Form I-907](https://www.uscis.gov/i-907), the form needed to request premium processing. It's helpful to cross reference the current processing times tool linked above if and when you apply for OPT to determine whether the extra premium processing fee is worth the significant added expense. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Which date should I select for the start date?",
        "answer": "It is important to carefully select the dates you request for your OPT because you will not be able to change these dates after you apply. If you are applying for [pre-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PreCompletionOPT.html), you should select the date that is your desired start date of employment. Keep in mind that it can take up to 3 months before you will be able to start working. If you are applying for [post-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PostCompletionOPT.html), your start date should be one to sixty days after your completion date. For example, if your completion date is May 20, your OPT can start anywhere from May 21 at the earliest and July 18 at the latest. However, if you think it will be challenging to find a job, you should select a later start date to ensure you do not waste your OPT time. Keep in mind if you find a job before this date, you won\u2019t be able to start working until you have the EAD card in hand and the OPT period has begun. "

        "answer": "If you will be moving but haven\u2019t received your card yet you will most likely need to change your address with the US government. If you have a trusted roommate or family member at the address listed on your OPT application and that person will be able to check your mail and will contact you immediately if anything arrives, ensure that you can still receive mail there and if so keep that address. However, if not, you should call the [National Service Customer line](https://www.uscis.gov/contactcenter) to ask for your address to be updated.

If your application has been pending for more than 5 months from the day the US government received your application, we suggest you take the following actions: If you have taken all of the above actions, 15 days after submitting a case inquiry, please email ogs@nyu.edu. When you email us, be sure to tell us when you last checked the USCIS website for your case status, when you submitted a case inquiry with USCIS, and when you called their Customer Service Center. Please also include a copy of your receipt notice from the USCIS on your OPT application. Please note, the soonest we can check with USCIS on your behalf is 15 days after the date you last contacted them. We can only request a courtesy inquiry and there is no guarantee that they will consider our request. That said, we have earlier seen USCIS reduce processing time for some applications when we have submitted courtesy inquiries.

        "answer": "If you want to travel while your STEM OPT application is pending and you will return from the US before your post-completion OPT end date, then you are fine to travel as long as you have all [alumni travel documents](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/documents-to-carry.html). If, however, you want to travel after the end date of your post-completion OPT EAD, you need to have your STEM OPT approved and have the STEM EAD card with you, along with proof that you have a job, in addition to your passport, valid F-1 visa and I-20 signed for travel in order to successfully get back into the US. We don\u2019t recommend you travel outside of the US after you finish your post-completion OPT unless you have your STEM OPT approved, the EAD card, and a job offer letter. If you will need to renew the F-1 visa in your passport while you travel, please review our [visa renewal information](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/how-to-get-a-new-visa.html).

        "question": "What if I can't find a job?",
        "answer": "Once your OPT begins--see the start date as listed on your EAD, the card you\u2019ll receive once your OPT is approved--you have a total of 90 days of unemployment during your OPT. If you cannot find a job within 90 days of the start of your OPT, then you must make plans to depart the US immediately or change to some other status in the US. Keep in mind that the 90 days of unemployment is for the entire OPT period. This means that if you use up 60 days of unemployment time looking for a job in the beginning, you only have 30 days of unemployment time for the remainder of your OPT period.

        "question": "What kind of job can I take on OPT?",
        "answer": "Your job should be directly related to your NYU major. In other words, you must be able to make a strong connection between your job and what you studied at NYU. If you can\u2019t make that connection, then you should not be working at that job for OPT. Often a job posting or advertisement will include the kinds of degrees the employer believes will be well suited to the advertised position. Having a copy of that job ad is helpful for your documentation that the job is connected to what you studied. You can also get a letter from your job supervisor indicating how your degree is essential for your position. It helps to keep copies of these documents so that if the US government ever wanted to see proof of how you were keeping your status legal while on OPT, you would have easy and ready proof to provide to them.

Students who work for a consulting firm or staffing agency should discuss their situation and eligibility with their employer to determine if a true employer/employee relationship exists in which the employer signing the training plan is also the employer that provides the practical training experience. Students should keep documentation of the justification for how the employer/employee relationship meets the requirements of the STEM OPT extension regulations. USCIS might ask for additional evidence of this relationship and justification during this application process or any future USCIS applications. This is a new regulation and we are still waiting for additional guidance from the US government on how this portion of the regulations will be interpreted. "

        "answer": "The IRS does not use phone calls or email to begin contact with you. Any communication from the IRS is done through a letter sent in the mail to your address. If you have received a phone call or email from someone claiming to be a representative of the IRS, hang up the call or do not respond to their email.

        "question": "I am a Canadian citizen preparing my yearly Canadian tax forms and I need NYU to provide me the TL-11A form.",
        "answer": "Upon request, NYU\u2019s Bursar Office is able to prepare and issue the Canadian Tax Form [TL-11A ](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/tl11a.html)(Tuition, Education, and Textbook Amounts Certificate - University Outside Canada).

    {
        "question": "How do I know if I was arrested?",
        "answer": "If you are arrested by the police in the US, you may be placed in handcuffs, the officer recites your \u201c[Miranda rights](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/miranda-rights-and-the-fifth-amendment.html)\u201d to you, and takes you into custody. You\u2019ve probably heard Miranda rights on US television shows. They include the lines \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d and \u201cYou have the right to consult an attorney.\u201d In addition to being taken into custody, it\u2019s important for you to realize that some seemingly minor interactions with the police can nevertheless result in an arrest record. For example, getting a Desk Appearance Ticket means that you have been arrested. \u00a0This means that you would need to answer \u201cyes\u201d to any questions about past arrest. Some examples of actions that could result in Desk Appearance Tickets or arrests: \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jumping a turnstile or going in through a subway exit gate, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any fight or argument leading to police interaction, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Underage drinking (legal drinking age in the US is 21 years), \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possession of Marijuana or other illegal drugs, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrying an open alcohol container or drinking in public, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Any behavior deemed to be sexual harassment or stalking, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Public urination, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being in a public park after closing, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being on private property without permission, including abandoned buildings or vacant lots, \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making graffiti or sidewalk art "
    },
    {
        "question": "Is being arrested the same as being charged with a crime?",
        "answer": "No. Normally a person is charged with a crime after being arrested but it is also possible that a person is charged with a crime before being arrested through a warrant for an arrest. The charge can come from either a prosecutor or a grand jury (called an indictment) and a court officer or judge will list the law/s you are alleged to have violated. It is possible to be arrested and released without ever being charged. This is where students often get a wrong impression and mistakenly answer \u201cno\u201d on the visa application. If you are ever arrested, you must still answer \u201cyes\u201d on the visa application question. If you ever find yourself charged with a crime, we recommend that you find two attorneys--one that specializes in immigration law and one that specializes in criminal law. \u00a0Without the guidance of the immigration attorney, a criminal attorney may not understand the legal impact of his or her advice on your immigration status. \u00a0It is important to have the right kind of attorney to help you understand the court proceedings and what they mean for your individual situation. "
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I know if I have been convicted?",
        "answer": "If you are never charged with a crime, you cannot be convicted. If you are charged with a crime, but the charges were dropped, you cannot be convicted unless new charges are filed later. If you are brought before a court and plead guilty or are found guilty, then you have been convicted. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Will an arrest or conviction prevent me from getting a visa in the future?",
        "answer": "Visas are granted at the discretion of the individual visa officer. Depending on the severity of the crime, a conviction may make it difficult or impossible for you to get a visa to enter the US. For advice about your specific case, you will need to contact a personal immigration attorney.  An arrest, even without a conviction, may have an impact on your current visa and/or your visa renewal, depending on the nature of the arrest (see more about DUIs below). Never give a false answer to any question during the visa process; be sure to answer \u201cyes\u201d if you are asked whether you have ever been arrested. Students have been denied a visa for giving a false answer to such a question. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Will an arrest or conviction cause me to lose my legal status while in the US?",
        "answer": "We are required by law to report, within 21 days, \u201cany disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime.\u201d This reporting action by itself does not automatically result in a termination of status. However, the information will be available to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will determine whether additional action is warranted. Additionally, if the disciplinary action is school suspension or expulsion, this may result in a loss of status for not maintaining full-time enrollment.  An arrest or conviction that does not result in a disciplinary action by NYU may still be reported by law enforcement officials to ICE; in which case, ICE officials would have the same discretion to determine whether additional action is warranted.

    {
        "question": "If I don\u2019t provide arrest information on the visa application, will embassy staff be able to find out whether I\u2019ve been arrested or convicted of a crime?",
        "answer": "Yes, they will most likely have access to this information through other sources. You should never give a false answer to this question on the visa application or in the visa interview. Providing false information on a visa application or during an interview could result in a finding of fraud. A finding of fraud could result in a permanent bar from entering the US. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Can an arrest or conviction affect any other types of immigration applications?",
        "answer": "You should assume that any application you file for an immigration benefit will involve a check for any arrest or criminal history. Extensive databases are maintained at the national level and are available to immigration authorities. You should consult with an immigration attorney about any history of arrest or conviction that may be of concern.

    {
        "question": "Is it possible my visa is cancelled without me knowing as a result of my arrest or conviction?",
        "answer": "Yes. It is possible that your current US visa stamp could be cancelled, especially if you have a \"Driving Under the Influence\" (DUI) or \"Driving While Intoxicated\" (DWI) arrest or conviction. Please note, even if you aren't arrested, it is possible this information is available to the US Consulate abroad and they may cancel your valid visa stamp currently on file. This could prevent you from reentering the US after travel abroad and/or successfully applying for a new visa stamp in the future. "
    },
    {
        "question": "What does it mean if my visa is cancelled?",
        "answer": "Typically, if your visa stamp itself has been cancelled but your status remains valid and unexpired, a visa cancellation does not disrupt your period of stay in the US unless you leave the US. If you depart the US, you must reapply for a new visa stamp. If you have drug or alcohol related arrests/convictions, you could be referred to a Panel Physician in your home country (or country of application) for evaluation during your visa interview. This physician will \u00a0make a determination if you are an \"abuser or addict\" and/or if you present a danger to yourself or others. It is possible that you can be required to stay at home for a year or more seeking treatment in order to be considered for another visa stamp.  You should only travel if you understand and are willing to risk not being able to return to the US for an extended period of time. \u00a0You may also want to retain an immigration attorney with details specific to your case. "
    },
    {
        "question": "What if my case is expunged or sealed? How does that impact my status or future visa applications?",
        "answer": "For immigration purposes a criminal conviction remains, no matter whether a court expunges your record or not. This means that your future visa applications could be affected, and you shouldn\u2019t assume that expunging or sealing your record will prevent you from experiencing any difficulty. We recommend that you find two attorneys: one who specializes in immigration law and one who specializes in criminal law to discuss further details surrounding your expunged or sealed case. "
