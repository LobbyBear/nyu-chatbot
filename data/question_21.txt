Q: If I defer the start of my academic program, do I need a new I-20/DS-2019? A: If you wish to defer the start of your academic program, you must request and receive permission from your academic department. (Tandon Graduate Students please go to [Tandon Graduate Academics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/graduate).) Please contact your academic department about deferring and any deadlines they might have for you to make that decision. If and when you are approved for a later start date, please [submit your US Entry Plan information](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/plan-your-trip/submit-your-us-entry-plan-information.html) to officially notify OGS so that we can update your I-20/DS-2019 with your new program start date.
