Q: I have questions on how to get a new visa for the US. If I can no longer make a visa appointment due to consulate and embassy delays, what should I now do? A: We recommend you continue to review the website of the consulate or embassy you intend to apply for your US visa at to be aware of any further updates in their services. To find the website of the consulate or embassy nearest you, review this listing of [websites of US Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions](https://www.usembassy.gov/).
