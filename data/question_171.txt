Q: Is it possible my visa is cancelled without me knowing as a result of my arrest or conviction? A: Yes. It is possible that your current US visa stamp could be cancelled, especially if you have a "Driving Under the Influence" (DUI) or "Driving While Intoxicated" (DWI) arrest or conviction. Please note, even if you aren't arrested, it is possible this information is available to the US Consulate abroad and they may cancel your valid visa stamp currently on file. This could prevent you from reentering the US after travel abroad and/or successfully applying for a new visa stamp in the future.
