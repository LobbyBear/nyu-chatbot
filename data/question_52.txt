Q: Can I apply for a Social Security Number and how? A: The OGS realizes that a SSN is requested for many transactions, from apartment rental to obtaining a cell phone or credit card, however, that is not the purpose for which the government designed it. The SSN is meant to be for tax-record keeping purposes only, thus, the government will only issue a number once you obtain work authorization.

Please note that the NYU ID number is not a Social Security Number. New students, transfer students, and students returning from a leave of absence can apply for a new US Social Security Number no earlier than 10 business days after entering the US and attending an OGS orientation. We will inform the US government that your SEVIS record is “active”. Thus the Social Security Administration may not have access to your immigration record until after ten business days of your active status.
