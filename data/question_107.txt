Q: I never received a receipt notice by mail from USCIS. What do I do to get it? A: You will need to confirm with the USCIS that they have your correct mailing address in their system. To do this, use either the [USCIS inquiry form](https://egov.uscis.gov/e-request/Intro.do) or call their [National Customer line](https://www.uscis.gov/contactcenter). You will need to know your receipt number when making an inquiry.
