Q: Can I enter the United States with my unexpired student visa even if I have a new SEVIS ID number? A: <a id="newstudentfaqvisa"></a>The US Department of State (the government agency issuing visas)Â Consulate Field Advisory Manual states that students should get a new visa. In practice, however, US Customs and Border Protection (the government agency you interact with when traveling into the US) has not indicated that this will be a problem and remains consistent in admitting students who are in this situation into the United States without issue. However, please note that this only applies to students who have already used their previous visa to enter the US at least once in the past.
