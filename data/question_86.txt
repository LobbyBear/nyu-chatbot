Q: The consulate cancelled my visa appointment. What do I do now? A: You should contact the consulate that cancelled your appointment to ask when the next available appointment is. After taking the next available appointment, you should continually monitor the consulateâ€™s website for new earlier appointments. We are unable to secure a new appointment for you and have no authority to influence the processing times or policies of consulates.
