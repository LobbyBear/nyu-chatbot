Q: I can't get a visa appointment in my home country and it seems unlikely that I'll be able to get one anytime soon. Can I go to another country to apply for my visa? A: OGS advises students to apply for a visa in their country of citizenship or residence as this is where an applicant can display strongest ties, hence a US consulate or embassy can best determine your non-immigrant intent. However, if you decide to apply for a visa outside of your country of citizenship or residence (as a third country national) then it is important to confirm that the US consulate or embassy in that location accepts F-1/J-1 visa applications from citizens of other countries. You will also want to consider the heightened cost, longer travel and processing times (that could include a quarantine requirement or administrative processing) and other associated risks.
