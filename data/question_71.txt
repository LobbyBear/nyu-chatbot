Q: My program offers another in-person module during the grace period of my existing I-20. Can I remain in the U.S. during the grace period to participate in the next in-person module? A: Students who enroll in a second in-person module starting within the 60 day grace period of an prior in-person module will need to depart the U.S. before we can issue the new I-20 form for the following module. OGS would have to complete the active I-20 form and this action may only occur if the student is not in the U.S. Report your departure to OGS by completing our [End my F-1/J-1 Status Form](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/end-f-1-j-1-immigration-status.html) before submitting the [Application for I-20/DS-2019.](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive.html)
