Q: How can I get an NYU ID Card? A: To [get an NYUCard](https://www.nyu.edu/life/campus-resources/nyu-card-and-campus-cash/get-an-nyucard.html#tripleBox_nyurichtext), visit [photoid.nyu.edu](http://photoid.nyu.edu) and follow the instructions to upload a photo to be used on your NYUCard. In order to properly access this system, students must have [activated their NYU NetID](http://start.nyu.edu) and NYU email accounts. An email will confirm the location where you will pick up your new card. You must bring your passport to the NYU Card Center in order to be issued an NYUCard. There is no charge for the first card. Always carry it with you, as you will not be granted access to NYU buildings without it.
