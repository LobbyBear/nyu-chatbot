Q: How do I submit my immunization information to NYU? A: In order to create a safer, healthier student body, there are [mandatory health and immunization requirements](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/next-stop-health-requirements.html) you must complete, including 1) health and immunization forms; 2) online training modules for sexual misconduct and alcohol use; and 3) health insurance. Each requirement helps create a safer, healthier NYU. We recommend you begin completing the health and immunization requirements as soon as possible to ensure you meet all the mandatory deadlines. Many of the requirements take time to complete and you might need to connect with your healthcare provider. The SHC team is here to help you navigate these requirements.
