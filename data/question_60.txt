Q: How do I apply for my I-20/DS-2019 from NYU? A: You will need to obtain an I-20 (F-1 status) or DS-2019 (J-1 status) from NYU before you can apply for your student visa. Most short-term students apply for the I-20/DS-2019 via our standard[ online application form](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/get-a-us-visa.html). <b>Please be sure to pay special attention when selecting your admitted program on the I-20/DS-2019 online application form so that our office knows that you are applying as a short-term student.</b> Your academic program will provide instructions regarding the appropriate option to select on the form. Students starting academic programs in one of the below categories should NOT apply via the online application form. Instead, you must follow the instructions your school and/or departmentÂ  provided you because they will apply for your immigration document on your behalf. <i>Visiting students from NYU Abu Dhabi and Shanghai</i> <i>MBA exchange students at NYU Stern</i> <i>J-1 graduate visiting students</i>
