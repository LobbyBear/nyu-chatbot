Q: Who can I speak to if I have tax questions? A: Due to the fact that we are not tax professionals and have very limited knowledge regarding taxes, the staff at OGS is not able to assist in completing tax forms or answering tax-related questions. If you are using Sprintax and have a specific question regarding your federal or state tax, you can contact their Live Chat system or email [hello@sprintax.com](https://www.nyu.edumailto:hello@sprintax.com). We can only direct you to helpful tax resources. Please see our [tax page](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/tax.html) for a list of tax resources and workshops available for international students. Make sure to first review all questions on this page, as your question may be answered here.
