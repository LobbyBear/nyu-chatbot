Q: When should I apply? How long does the application take? A: You can start applying for your OPT 90 days before either your proposed employment start date if you are applying for [pre-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PreCompletionOPT.html) or 90 days before your program completion date if you are applying for [post-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PostCompletionOPT.html). You will first need to apply for your OPT I-20 with OGS which can take up to two weeks. OGS handles all NYU OPT applications and works as fast as possible to issue OPT I-20s. If your I-20 is ready before the 2 weeks processing time, we will let you know. Once you apply for the EAD with the US government it can take approximately up to 3.5 months time to process your application. Check the [US government processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/). [You must select "I-765" for form type. For Field Office or Service Center, most of our students' applications go to the Potomac Service Center.] For December graduates, that means you should apply by mid September; for May graduates, by mid February. By applying early, you can avoid the risks that come from an OPT request being denied after the grace period has ended. In addition, delaying your application will not allow you to stay longer in the US. Students can choose to file for [premium processing](https://www.uscis.gov/i-907) and follow the instructions on the USCIS website.
