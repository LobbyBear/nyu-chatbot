Q: How can I apply for a driver license or photo ID card? A: A driver license is required to operate an automobile anywhere in the US. New York honors all valid foreign licenses. We suggest you also have an [International Driver Permit](https://www.usa.gov/visitors-driving), which translates your country’s driver license. You must apply for one in your home country <i>before coming to the US.</i> You do not need to apply for a New York driver license unless you become a resident of New York State (students from other states or other nations are not normally considered residents of New York State). If you reside in the state of New York, learn more about [getting a driver's license in New York](https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-licenses). If you reside in the state of New Jersey for more than 60 days, you may obtain a [New Jersey driver’s license](https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/license/firstlic.htm). You can also obtain a non-driver photo ID card from the [New Jersey MVC](http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/license/nondriverid.htm) or [New York DMV](https://dmv.ny.gov/non-driver-id-card). A non-driver photo ID may be helpful as proof of identity for renting an apartment, gaining entry to certain venues, or applying for credit. You must have a [US Social Security card](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/social-security-number.html#tripleBox_nyurichtext_4) (or a letter from US Social Security Administration stating you are ineligible for a SSN) in order to apply. In addition, you must present your passport, I-94 record and I-20 or DS-2019 showing that you have authorization to be in the US for at least six months into the future. You must also provide documents for proof of identity and date of birth which may include either a bank card with printed name, bank statement or a credit card, and a US utility bill. The [IDNYC program](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/idnyc/index.page) offers a photo identification card for residents of New York City who are at least 14 years old. This municipal ID card connects New Yorkers to services, programs, and benefits, regardless of immigration status, homeless status, or gender identity.
