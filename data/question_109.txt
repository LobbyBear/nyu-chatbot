Q: I received a notice from USCIS that I need to send them more information. What do I do? A: As soon as you receive the letter from USCIS, come to the OGS during our [in person advising hours](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html). We will review the reason for the letter together and help you prepare the requested documents.
