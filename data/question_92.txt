Q: During the fall/spring semester, can I work more than 20 hours/week combined doing both on-campus employment and CPT simultaneously? A: There is no US immigration regulation that prohibits doing both types of work simultaneously. However, it is possible that the US government could ask for further clarification should you apply for a US benefit or visa if you choose to work in excess of 20 hours/week of on-campus work and CPT combined. Remember that your primary intention in the US in F-1 status is to be a full-time student; it is not to work.
