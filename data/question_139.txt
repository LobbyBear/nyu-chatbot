Q: Can I begin a new degree program while working on STEM OPT? A: US government regulations state that optional practical training employment (including STEM OPT) is automatically terminated when a student transfers to another school or begins study at another educational level. Only recreational or avocational classes are permissible while on STEM OPT.
