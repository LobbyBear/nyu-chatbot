Q: I am a graduate student. I want to take a gap semester or leave of absence. Will this affect my CPT eligibility? A: For graduate students, taking a leave of absence may potentially affect your CPT eligibility. Typically, students must maintain status in the US for two consecutive semesters (spring and fall semesters, one academic year) before becoming eligible to apply for CPT. By applying for a [Personal Leave of Absence](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/take-a-leave-of-absence/personal-leave-of-absence.html) or gap semester, you are creating a break in your studies. This would mean that most students would need to maintain status in the US for another consecutive fall and spring semester before becoming eligible for CPT. If your program requires immediate participation in an off-campus opportunity, [please discuss this with an OGS advisor](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html#AdvisingAppointments).
