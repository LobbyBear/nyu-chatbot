Q: I have a STEM OPT application pending with USCIS and have a new job. What do I need to do? A: You must first submit this change to our [STEM OPT Reporting Form](https://ogsonline.ogs.nyu.edu/istart/controllers/client/ClientEngine.cfm?serviceid=EFormSTEMOPTReporting1ServiceProvider) in order to report that you've ended employment and are now adding new employment. This must happen within 10 days of the changes, and you must be prepared to upload several documents to our reporting form.
