Q: How do I know if I have been convicted? A: If you are never charged with a crime, you cannot be convicted. If you are charged with a crime, but the charges were dropped, you cannot be convicted unless new charges are filed later. If you are brought before a court and plead guilty or are found guilty, then you have been convicted.
