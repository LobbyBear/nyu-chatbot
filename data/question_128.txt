Q: I am on STEM OPT and have been put on furlough. Is furlough considered unemployment that will then count towards my maximum unemployment days? A: USCIS has not provided any guidance on this till now. They could potentially interpret any days the employee is on furlough as contributing to days of unemployment, therefore we believe it safest for students to try to secure some other work consisting of at least 20 hours per week in their field of study to prevent the accrual of further potential unemployment days. Remember that any other work you may be able to secure must be paid and at an e-verified employer (in addition to the position being in your STEM field of study and appropriate to your level of study).
