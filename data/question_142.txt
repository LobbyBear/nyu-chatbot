Q: I just received a Form 1095-B. What do I need to do with it? A: Form 1095-B is a tax form that reports the type of health insurance coverage you have. The 1095-B is NOT needed to file a Non Resident Tax Return. If, however, you are a resident for tax purposes, you will need to refer to it when completing your tax filing responsibilities. Regardless, save this form along with your other tax documents.
