Q: If I transfer my SEVIS record, will I need to apply for a new visa? A: If you transfer your SEVIS record and you still have a valid, unexpired visa, you can use this visa to re-enter the United States.  However, please be aware of certain [country-specific travel restrictions](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/travel-and-visitors/travel-advisory-related-to-china.html) that are in effect regardless of visa validity.
