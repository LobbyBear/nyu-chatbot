Q: How do I know if I was arrested? A: If you are arrested by the police in the US, you may be placed in handcuffs, the officer recites your “[Miranda rights](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/miranda-rights-and-the-fifth-amendment.html)” to you, and takes you into custody. You’ve probably heard Miranda rights on US television shows. They include the lines “You have the right to remain silent,” and “You have the right to consult an attorney.” In addition to being taken into custody, it’s important for you to realize that some seemingly minor interactions with the police can nevertheless result in an arrest record. For example, getting a Desk Appearance Ticket means that you have been arrested.  This means that you would need to answer “yes” to any questions about past arrest. Some examples of actions that could result in Desk Appearance Tickets or arrests: ●      Jumping a turnstile or going in through a subway exit gate, ●      Any fight or argument leading to police interaction, ●      Underage drinking (legal drinking age in the US is 21 years), ●      Possession of Marijuana or other illegal drugs, ●      Carrying an open alcohol container or drinking in public, ●      Any behavior deemed to be sexual harassment or stalking, ●      Public urination, ●      Being in a public park after closing, ●      Being on private property without permission, including abandoned buildings or vacant lots, ●      Making graffiti or sidewalk art
