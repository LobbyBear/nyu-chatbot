Q: I plan to move and I haven't received my "OPT card" yet. What should I do? A: If you will be moving but havenâ€™t received your card yet you will most likely need to change your address with the US government. If you have a trusted roommate or family member at the address listed on your OPT application and that person will be able to check your mail and will contact you immediately if anything arrives, ensure that you can still receive mail there and if so keep that address. However, if not, you should call the [National Service Customer line](https://www.uscis.gov/contactcenter) to ask for your address to be updated. You can find this phone number on your receipt notice. They will give you details on how to change your address. You may also directly change your address online via the [USCIS Case Status Landing page.](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do)Once there, click "Change of Address" and follow the instructions. If you are using someone else's address, be sure to fill out the "In Care of for Mailing, C/O" section. Additionally, you may sign up for [USPS Informed Delivery](https://www.usps.com/manage/informed-delivery.htm) to monitor the delivery of your mail. This is another mechanism to track any expected deliveries from USCIS.
