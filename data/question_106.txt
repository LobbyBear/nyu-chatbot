Q: My application is taking a long time. Can I do anything to speed up the process? A: The US government has specific [criteria for expediting an application](http://www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria). If your application has been pending for more than 5 months from the day the US government received your application, we suggest you take the following actions: If you have taken all of the above actions, 15 days after submitting a case inquiry, please email ogs@nyu.edu. When you email us, be sure to tell us when you last checked the USCIS website for your case status, when you submitted a case inquiry with USCIS, and when you called their Customer Service Center. Please also include a copy of your receipt notice from the USCIS on your OPT application. Please note, the soonest we can check with USCIS on your behalf is 15 days after the date you last contacted them. We can only request a courtesy inquiry and there is no guarantee that they will consider our request. That said, we have earlier seen USCIS reduce processing time for some applications when we have submitted courtesy inquiries. In addition, full details on how to request premium (or expedited) processing is on the USCIS webpage for the [Form I-907](https://www.uscis.gov/i-907), the form needed to request premium processing. It's helpful to cross reference the current processing times tool linked above if and when you apply for OPT to determine whether the extra premium processing fee is worth the significant added expense.
