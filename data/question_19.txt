Q: I submitted my I-20/DS-2019 transfer application more than 2 weeks ago but I still haven’t received my document. Why is that? A: In order to issue your I-20/DS-2019, we must have a fully completed application from you AND your SEVIS record must be released in the SEVIS database. Furthermore, the release date of your SEVIS record must pass before we have access to your record. If after you have fully submitted your application and you have confirmed with your previous school that your record was released and it’s been more than 2 weeks, please feel free to contact us at [newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu](https://www.nyu.edumailto:newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu).
