Q: Is being arrested the same as being charged with a crime? A: No. Normally a person is charged with a crime after being arrested but it is also possible that a person is charged with a crime before being arrested through a warrant for an arrest. The charge can come from either a prosecutor or a grand jury (called an indictment) and a court officer or judge will list the law/s you are alleged to have violated. It is possible to be arrested and released without ever being charged. This is where students often get a wrong impression and mistakenly answer “no” on the visa application. If you are ever arrested, you must still answer “yes” on the visa application question. If you ever find yourself charged with a crime, we recommend that you find two attorneys--one that specializes in immigration law and one that specializes in criminal law.  Without the guidance of the immigration attorney, a criminal attorney may not understand the legal impact of his or her advice on your immigration status.  It is important to have the right kind of attorney to help you understand the court proceedings and what they mean for your individual situation.
