Q: Will an arrest or conviction prevent me from getting a visa in the future? A: Visas are granted at the discretion of the individual visa officer. Depending on the severity of the crime, a conviction may make it difficult or impossible for you to get a visa to enter the US. For advice about your specific case, you will need to contact a personal immigration attorney.  An arrest, even without a conviction, may have an impact on your current visa and/or your visa renewal, depending on the nature of the arrest (see more about DUIs below). Never give a false answer to any question during the visa process; be sure to answer “yes” if you are asked whether you have ever been arrested. Students have been denied a visa for giving a false answer to such a question.
