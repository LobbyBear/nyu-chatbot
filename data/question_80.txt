Q: Will time spent working remotely outside the United States count towards my unemployment limit? A: During the current COVID-19 crisis, the US government has indicated that remote employment may be counted for OPT purposes as long as a student’s employer has an office outside of the United States or the employer can assess student engagement using electronic means. See this [guidance from the US government](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/coronavirus/covid19faq.pdf) for further details.
