Q: How do I pay for classes? A: You can make payments to your student account at the [Office of the University Bursar](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds.html). If you will be paying by international wire transfers, review the Bursar's information on [international payments](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/methods-of-payment/international-payments.html).
