Q: What do I need to know about following the laws in the US? A: Our office is here to help you understand how to keep your status legal while studying in the US. We go over information about how to do this at our [orientation sessions](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/when-you-arrive/mandatory-check-in.html). If ever you find that you have been arrested or have had any interaction with police, please be sure to let the OGS know immediately. Please also see our information on the [effect an arrest could have on your immigration status](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/effect-of-arrest-on-immigration-status.html).
