Q: I received an I-20/DS-2019 from NYU but am unable to travel to the United States in time for the program start date listed on my document. What should I do? A: If you plan to arrive in the United States after the program start date as indicated on your current I-20 or DS-2019, we must change the start date listed on your document and send you an updated I-20 or DS-2019 as long as it is supported by your academic department. [For Tandon Graduate students, please reach out to [Tandon Graduate Academics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/support-services/graduate).] Please [submit your US Entry Plan information](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/plan-your-trip/submit-your-us-entry-plan-information.html) to OGS so that we can update your document accordingly. Note that if you cannot arrive within 30 days <i>after</i> the semester begins, you might choose to defer your start date to a future semester, or to utilize remote study if available, etc. If you find yourself in this circumstance, please contact both your academic department and OGS to discuss your situation and find the best option for you.
