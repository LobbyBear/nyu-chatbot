Q: I am still waiting to receive my tax refund for last year. Who can I contact? A: If you are expecting a refund based on the federal tax return you filed and there has been no update to your refund status on the [IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96596,00.html), you may send a letter to the IRS requesting the status of your income tax refund. Your letter should be sent to the same address as your tax return.  In the letter, include your name and Social Security Number or ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) data.  Attach a copy of your originally filed income tax return clearly marked “COPY”. Send your letter using certified mail, return receipt requested; or by using FedEx/UPS so that you will have proof of delivery. Also keep a copy of the letter and all other documents you sent for your records. If the IRS contacts you, they will contact you by sending a letter in the mail. The IRS does not contact individuals by email or phone calls. If you do receive an email or phone call from a person claiming to be a representative of the IRS, do not respond to their questions. Visit the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-urges-public-to-stay-alert-for-scam-phone-calls) regarding IRS scams. If you used Glacier Tax Prep (GTP) to prepare last year’s federal tax return, GTP will assist you in responding to the IRS. Contact the GTP Support Center via the HELP Link from within GTP.  No email inquiries will be accepted. If you are waiting for a tax return from New York State, contact the [New York State Department of Taxation and Finance](https://www.tax.ny.gov/). For a New Jersey state tax return, contact the [New Jersey Division of Taxation](http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/taxation/index.shtml).
