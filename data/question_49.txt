Q: How do I get health care at NYU Brooklyn? A: Most [SHC services](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/services.html) are now offered virtually. Due to COVID-19, it is not advisable to visit a medical facility unless absolutely necessary. If you have a medical concern, call the SHC at (212) 443-1000 and ask to speak with a nurse. If you have a mental health concern, call the Wellness Exchange 24/7 hotline at (212) 443-9999.
