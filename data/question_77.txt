Q: I am in F-1 status and will be completing my academic program/post-completion OPT/STEM OPT soon. I am concerned that I will not be able to leave the United States before my 60 day grace period ends. What options exist for me? A: [US government guidance](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/coronavirus/covid19faq.pdf) has indicated that there is not currently any flexibility on extending the grace period for F-1 students. <i>For students completing their academic program soon:</i>

All students in F-1 status have up to sixty days after their program end date (this is the day you complete all requirements for your academic program) to decide what they will do next. This sixty days is also referred to as your “grace period.” Please review the options available to students who are graduating on our [alumni page](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni.html). If you're an F-1 student and want to work, you must apply for [OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training.html) within a month of completing your studies. If you are staying on at NYU to do another academic program, apply for a new I-20 or DS-2019 on our [Change Major or Degree page](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/change-major-or-degree.html). If you are starting an academic program at another school within the US, learn how to [transfer out of NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/transfer-out-of-NYU.html). These are all options that would permit you to continue to remain in the United States. If, however, you are not interested in pursuing any of these options, we encourage you to [schedule an online advising appointment](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us/schedule-online-appointment-ogs-advisor.html) to discuss whether changing from F-1 to another status in the United States may be a viable option for you. <i>For students completing their Post-Completion OPT soon:</i>

All students in F-1 status who have not yet accrued ninety days of unemployment during the post-completion OPT time period have up to sixty days after their OPT end date to remain legally in the United States. This sixty days is also referred to as your “grace period.” If, however, you wish to see if you can extend your time in the United States even further, one option would be STEM OPT, which may be a possibility for students who are currently on post-completion OPT, and who completed their degree at NYU (or a previous degree from another college or university within the United States) in a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) field. You can find further details, including eligibility requirements on our [STEM OPT extension page](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/stem-opt.html). If you are currently on post-completion OPT and you have an employer interested in sponsoring you for an H-1B work visa, you may also be eligible to apply for a [Cap Gap Extension](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/cap-gap-extension.html). If, however, neither of these options are possible for you, we encourage you to [schedule an online advising appointment](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us/schedule-online-appointment-ogs-advisor.html) to discuss whether changing from F-1 to another status in the United States may be a viable option for you. <i>For students completing their STEM OPT soon:</i>

Students in F-1 status who have not yet accrued 150 days of unemployment during the post-completion and STEM OPT time period have up to sixty days after their STEM OPT end date to remain legally in the United States. This sixty days is also referred to as your “grace period.” If, however, you wish to see if you can extend your time in the United States even further, one option would be the cap gap extension. If you are currently on STEM OPT and you have an employer interested in sponsoring you for an H-1B work visa, you may be eligible to apply for a [Cap Gap Extension](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/cap-gap-extension.html). If this option is not possible for you, we encourage you to [schedule an online advising appointment](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us/schedule-online-appointment-ogs-advisor.html) to discuss whether changing from F-1 to another status in the United States may be a viable option for you.
