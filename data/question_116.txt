Q: Can I have more than one employer while on OPT? A: Remember, your OPT is not linked to one employer; this means that you can have more than one employer while on OPT as long as every job you have is directly related to your major. You can also review [the government's policy guidance on OPT](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/opt_policy_guidance_042010.pdf).
