Q: Can I work remotely while on CPT? A: Generally speaking, remote work is a possibility, but it depends on where you are physically working from, and where your company is physically based. CPT is designed for students to work for a US-based company while students are physically located in the US. If you are pursuing remote work while you are in the US with a US-based employer, you should have evidence for your personal immigration records that you are receiving direct, regular, and appropriate supervision for your training in your experiential opportunity. For more details and guidance on this matter, it would be best to [speak with an OGS advisor at length about your individual situation](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html).
