Q: What does it mean if my visa is cancelled? A: Typically, if your visa stamp itself has been cancelled but your status remains valid and unexpired, a visa cancellation does not disrupt your period of stay in the US unless you leave the US. If you depart the US, you must reapply for a new visa stamp. If you have drug or alcohol related arrests/convictions, you could be referred to a Panel Physician in your home country (or country of application) for evaluation during your visa interview. This physician will  make a determination if you are an "abuser or addict" and/or if you present a danger to yourself or others. It is possible that you can be required to stay at home for a year or more seeking treatment in order to be considered for another visa stamp.  You should only travel if you understand and are willing to risk not being able to return to the US for an extended period of time.  You may also want to retain an immigration attorney with details specific to your case.
