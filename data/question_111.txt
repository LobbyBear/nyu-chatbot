Q: Can I travel while the OPT application is pending? A: If you want to travel while your OPT application is pending and you haven’t yet reached your completion date, then you are fine to travel. In other words, if you still haven’t finished your degree at NYU, as indicated on your I-20, then travel is the same as it has been; you’ll need to bring with you the same documents we normally recommend you have with you when you travel. For a full list of documents needed for reentry into the US, please review the items on the [Travel and Visitors](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/travel-and-visitors.html) page. If, however, you want to travel <u style="">after the end date as listed on page 1 of your I-20</u>, you need to have your OPT approved and have the EAD card with you, along with proof that you have a job, in addition to your passport, valid F-1 visa and I-20 signed for travel in order to successfully get back into the US. We don’t recommend you travel outside of the US after you finish your degree unless you have your OPT approved, the EAD card, and a job offer letter. For a full list of documents needed for travel after your program end date elapses, please review the items on the [Documents to Carry](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/documents-to-carry.html) page. If you will need to renew the F-1 visa in your passport while you travel, please review the information on how to [renew your visa](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/travel-and-visitors/renew-your-us-visa.html).
