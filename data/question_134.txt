Q: I have a prior degree in a STEM field from another US institution and am currently on post-completion OPT for a non-STEM degree from NYU. Am I eligible for the STEM extension? A: You may be eligible for a 24-month STEM OPT extension if your employment meets all of the other eligibility requirements and you did not previously complete a STEM extension based on that degree. In order to be eligible, you must have earned a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree in an [eligible field](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/eligible-cip-codes-for-the-stem-opt-extension) at an accredited and US government-certified school within the last 10 years. You will need to provide all old I-20s to show that the degree was in an eligible field as designated by the CIP (or major) code. If you do not have an I-20 with the prior degree CIP code, speak with an OGS advisor regarding documentation you can provide to show eligibility. Your employment on the STEM OPT extension must be directly related to the STEM degree you previously completed.
