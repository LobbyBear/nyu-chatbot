Q: I am no longer living in the US. Do I still need to file taxes in the US? A: Yes, all international visitors present in the United States for even one day last year must file a tax report for that year. If you were employed in the US during the past year, contact the employer(s) you worked for and request a copy of your Form W-2 to be mailed to your address abroad. Ask your employer(s) if you are able to access your Form W-2 online. If you overpaid federal tax, the IRS can mail a refund check overseas.
