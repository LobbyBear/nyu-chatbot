Q: I’m filling out the DS-160 and it asks me to fill out the address of where I will be staying in the US as well as a US-based contact. What if I don’t have either of those yet? A: If you don’t know your US address yet, you can use OGS’s address (383 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10003). If you don’t have a US-based contact, you can use the name of the individual who signed your I-20 or DS-2019.
