Q: Can I travel while the STEM OPT application is pending? A: If you want to travel while your STEM OPT application is pending and you will return from the US before your post-completion OPT end date, then you are fine to travel as long as you have all [alumni travel documents](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/documents-to-carry.html). If, however, you want to travel after the end date of your post-completion OPT EAD, you need to have your STEM OPT approved and have the STEM EAD card with you, along with proof that you have a job, in addition to your passport, valid F-1 visa and I-20 signed for travel in order to successfully get back into the US. We donâ€™t recommend you travel outside of the US after you finish your post-completion OPT unless you have your STEM OPT approved, the EAD card, and a job offer letter. If you will need to renew the F-1 visa in your passport while you travel, please review our [visa renewal information](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/how-to-get-a-new-visa.html).
