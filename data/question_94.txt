Q: I am an undergraduate student. I want to take a gap semester or leave of absence. Will this affect my CPT eligibility? A: For undergraduate students, taking a leave of absence will always affect your CPT eligibility. Undergraduate students must maintain status in the US for two consecutive semesters (spring and fall semesters, one academic year) before becoming eligible to apply for CPT. By applying for a [Personal Leave of Absence](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/visa-and-academic-changes/take-a-leave-of-absence/personal-leave-of-absence.html) or gap semester, you are creating a break in your studies. This would mean that you must maintain status in the US for another consecutive fall and spring semester before becoming eligible for CPT. If you have questions, [please discuss this with an OGS advisor](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html#AdvisingAppointments).
