Q: What if my case is expunged or sealed? How does that impact my status or future visa applications? A: For immigration purposes a criminal conviction remains, no matter whether a court expunges your record or not. This means that your future visa applications could be affected, and you shouldnâ€™t assume that expunging or sealing your record will prevent you from experiencing any difficulty. We recommend that you find two attorneys: one who specializes in immigration law and one who specializes in criminal law to discuss further details surrounding your expunged or sealed case.
