Q: If I take all my courses for the upcoming semester remotely, do I still need to get a visa for the upcoming semester? A: No, you do not need a US student visa in order to begin your studies remotely from outside of the United States. You will, however, need a student visa in order to get into the United States. This means that you must have an I-20 or DS-2019 from NYU and an F-1 or J-1 student visa (except for Canadian citizens) at the time that you do travel into the United States to begin or continue your studies at NYU.
