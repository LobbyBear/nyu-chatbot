Q: Do F-1 and J-1 students need health insurance to study at NYU? A: J-1 students are required by law to carry [adequate levels of health insurance](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/when-you-arrive/required-health-insurance-coverage.html); failure to do so results in termination from the Exchange Visitor program. We send information to all J-1 students about the insurance requirements with your initial DS-2019 form. When all F-1 and J-1 international students register for classes, they will be automatically charged for the NYU-sponsored comprehensive insurance plan. Check your bursar bill for insurance charges. Review detailed information on the [NYU Health Insurance](https://www.nyu.edu/students/health-and-wellness/student-health-insurance.html) page for important information.
