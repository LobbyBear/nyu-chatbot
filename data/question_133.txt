Q: I completed an eligible STEM degree and work for a consulting firm or staffing agency. Am I eligible for the STEM OPT extension? A: The regulations for the 24-month STEM OPT extension indicate that this is not sufficient for the extension as the training and supervision typically occurs with a company that is not the studentâ€™s employer. Students who work for a consulting firm or staffing agency should discuss their situation and eligibility with their employer to determine if a true employer/employee relationship exists in which the employer signing the training plan is also the employer that provides the practical training experience. Students should keep documentation of the justification for how the employer/employee relationship meets the requirements of the STEM OPT extension regulations. USCIS might ask for additional evidence of this relationship and justification during this application process or any future USCIS applications. This is a new regulation and we are still waiting for additional guidance from the US government on how this portion of the regulations will be interpreted.
