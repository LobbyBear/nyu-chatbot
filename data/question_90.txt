Q: I submitted my passport to a consulate, but I need it back now because I have to travel internationally. A: If a true emergency has developed and you need your passport for international travel, you should contact the consulate where you submitted your application. In some cases, withdrawing your passport may mean you have withdrawn your entire visa application. You may need to start the visa process over again from the beginning. The consulate will be able to inform you about any impact withdrawing your passport would have.
