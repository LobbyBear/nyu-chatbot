Q: Is there a way I can set up a mobile phone number before arriving in the United States? A: campusSIMS sends any student who completes [their order form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17zvnfgezr99bnU3FOmV4Xfsv8_dDXL6LKjLGq9D3Uts/viewform?edit_requested=true) a free SIM card in their home country so that students can get a US phone number immediately, and have mobile phone service as soon as they arrive in the United States. Please note, only the SIM card is free. They have plans available for a fee. More details are available on their order form.
