Q: Do I need to file for taxes even though I did not earn any US income last year? A: Yes. Whether or not you earned income last year in the United States, all international visitors are required to file a federal tax form called the Form 8843 with the IRS, even if they were present in the US for only one day of that year. Sprintax, a software program available on our [tax page](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/tax.html), will assist you in completing the Form 8843. You will need to submit the completed form to the IRS as instructed by Sprintax.
