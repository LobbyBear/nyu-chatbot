Q: Do I need a student visa to enroll at NYU? A: International students should hold an immigration status that permits study in the United States to attend classes at NYU. If you require sponsorship from NYU to apply for your visa, we can assist you in obtaining F-1 or J-1 student status. <b>Please note that NYU advises strongly against a B-1/B-2 visa or Visa Waiver (ESTA) for short-term students as study is considered a violation of B-1/B-2 or ESTA status.</b>
