Q: Why didn’t I receive a Form 1098-T? A: The Form 1098-T is issued to students to show the amount of tuition paid for federal tax deduction reasons. Most international students are not eligible for the tax credit but you can talk to a tax professional if you are considered a dependent of a US citizen or US permanent resident and think you are eligible. Keep in mind, however, that the 1098-T can only be issued if you have a US Social Security number (SSN) or an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN).  According to the NYU Bursar's FAQ question, ["Why am I not eligible for a 1098-T?"](https://www.nyu.edu/bursar/tax.topics/faqs.html#q11), you can use a statement of accounts in lieu of the 1098-T. If you have any further questions about the 1098-T or if you need a 1098-T issued because you are a dependent of someone who is filing taxes as a resident or you are a resident for US tax purposes yourself, visit the [NYU Bursar’s](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/1098t.html) website for instructions on how to access your 1098-T.
