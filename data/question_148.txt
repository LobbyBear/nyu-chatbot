Q: During the last year, I received a US-based scholarship/fellowship/grant. Do I need to file taxes? A: Yes. Depending on the type of scholarship/fellowship/grant you received and whether your country has a tax treaty ([IRS Publication 901- U.S. Tax Treaty](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p901.pdf)) with the US, you may need to report your scholarship as US income. You should receive a tax document from the organization that issued your scholarship. US source scholarships/fellowships/grants that are beyond the amount of tuition and fees are usually considered taxable. If you received a taxable scholarship from NYU, you should receive Form 1042-S from NYU. For more information on taxable and nontaxable scholarship items, please visit NYU’s Global Tax Compliance Department ‘[U.S. Tax Information for Nonresident Alien Students and Scholars](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/financelink/tax.html)’. If you did not complete GLACIER when you first received your NYU scholarship/fellowship/grant, contact [NYU.Glacier@nyu.edu](https://www.nyu.edumailto:NYU.Glacier@nyu.edu).
