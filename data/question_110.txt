Q: I need to change my mailing address. How do I do that? A: Go to the US government's website to check your USCIS CASE Status Online: [https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do). Once there, click "Change of Address" and follow the instructions. If you are using someone else's address, be sure to fill out "In Care of for Mailing, C/O" section.
