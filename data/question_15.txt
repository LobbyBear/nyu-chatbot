Q: Can I enter the US as a tourist and then change to F-1 status if I already have a valid tourist visa? A: No. You must enter the United States in F-1 or J-1 student status. If you happen to have a valid tourist visa and try to enter the United States as a tourist, you will immediately be in violation of your tourist status if you are enrolled in a full course of study. Therefore, you must wait until you have a valid student visa (unless youâ€™re a Canadian citizen) to enter the United States to begin your program of study.
