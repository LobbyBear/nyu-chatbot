Q: I have a prior degree in a STEM field from a school outside the US and am currently on post-completion OPT for a non-STEM degree from NYU. Am I eligible for the STEM OPT extension? A: No, the regulations require a student to complete a STEM degree in an eligible field from an accredited and US government-certified US institution. Students are not eligible for the extension based on a degree earned outside the US.
