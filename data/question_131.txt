Q: I completed an eligible STEM degree and am working as an unpaid intern. Am I eligible for the STEM OPT extension? A: No, the regulations for the 24-month extension require that students have an employer/employee relationship and be earning the same wage as a similar US worker. The US government has specifically stated that unpaid internships and volunteer work do not qualify for the 24-month STEM OPT extension.
