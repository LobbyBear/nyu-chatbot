Q: How do I make my visa interview appointment? A: You should wait to schedule your visa appointment until you have received your original I-20 or DS-2019 from us. Remember that it takes around 2 weeks for us to process your I-20 or DS-2019. Be sure to complete all required forms and pay the required fees before your appointment.
