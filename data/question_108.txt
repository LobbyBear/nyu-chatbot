Q: I didn't receive my "OPT card" by mail. What do I do if I think it's lost? A: Create an [inquiry with USCIS](https://egov.uscis.gov/e-request/displayNDCForm.do;jsessionid=abc-AwldZxpio6pawvKav?entryPoint=init&sroPageType=ndc). If you are having issues with your EAD being lost or misdirected, consider completing this [USCIS case assistance request form](https://cisomb.dhs.gov/oca/form7001.aspx). If you would like to provide consent for an advisor at OGS to speak with USCIS about your issues, please upload a signed statement indicating your consent for OGS staff to speak with USCIS. If the card is lost, and USCIS cannot simply resend it to you, then you will have to apply for a replacement card. Review the process to [replace a lost or stolen EAD](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/ReplaceEADCard.html) if you need to apply to replace your card.
