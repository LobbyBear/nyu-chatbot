Q: I am enrolled in a modular or low-residency degree program, will my I-20 cover the full duration of my program? A: If you are enrolled in a modular or low-residency graduate program that holds short-term classes based at an NYU campus, it is important to note that the I-20 can only be issued for each module and one F-1 record cannot be maintained for the entirety of the program. You will need to obtain a new I-20 with a new SEVIS ID and pay the corresponding [SEVIS fee](https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html) for each module based in the United States.
