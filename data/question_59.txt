Q: What is the difference between the F-1 and J-1 student visa? A: You can find a [comprehensive overview of the F-1 and J-1 visa categories](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/get-a-us-visa/prepare-your-documents.html) on our website. <b>Note that students participating in a formal exchange program attend NYU on the J-1 visa only and are waived from the non-personal funding requirement.Â 

</b>Exchange students only need to demonstrate funding for living expenses and health insurance as tuition and fees are waived per the exchange agreement between NYU and your home school. NYU cannot offer J-1 sponsorship for programs fewer than three weeks long. If your program is fewer than three weeks long, you will need to apply for an F-1 visa.
