Q: How can I report my required STEM OPT update while OGS is closed and still make my reporting deadline? A: Please note that OGS has <i><b>an additional 15-day reporting window</b></i> to submit your STEM report to the government. If you have submitted your STEM report by your deadline, no further action is required.  Rest assured that OGS will submit your report before our deadlines. For further information, please review our [STEM OPT Reporting Requirements](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/stem-opt/reporting-requirements.html) and [the STEM OPT FAQ](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/stem-opt/FAQs-on-the-new-regulations-for-STEM-OPT.html).
