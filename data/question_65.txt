Q: I am a visiting non-degree student, how many classes can I take? A: F-1 and J-1 students sponsored by NYU must enroll in a full course of study to be eligible for student visa sponsorship. Full-time enrollment for visiting students over the fall and spring is typically defined as a minimum of 12 credits/units per semester, or 9 credits for students studying at the graduate level. Failure to maintain a full-time course load is considered a violation of legal immigration status and can negatively impact your ability to stay and study in the United States. If you are a visiting student admitted to a summer program, full-time enrollment for the summer is defined as a minimum of: 6 credits for a 6 week session 3 credits for a 3 week session or 12 credits for a 12 week session Or, you may take non-credit courses that meet a total of at least 18 hours per week. If you have questions about full-time enrollment requirements or are not sure if your program qualifies as full-time, please [contact us](https://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html) and/or your program administrator.
