Q: I received a threatening call or email “from the IRS” demanding payment or banking information immediately.  What should I do? A: The IRS does not use phone calls or email to begin contact with you. Any communication from the IRS is done through a letter sent in the mail to your address. If you have received a phone call or email from someone claiming to be a representative of the IRS, hang up the call or do not respond to their email. Incidents like these are scams and fake schemes intended to steal money or banking information from their victims. The [IRS has issued stern warnings to the public](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-urges-public-to-stay-alert-for-scam-phone-calls) against these scams and asks individuals to protect themselves and not be a victim. If you have received one of these calls or emails, stop by our [Advising Hours](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html) to speak to an OGS advisor or email us. You should also report this online to the [Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml) or by calling 800-366-4484.
