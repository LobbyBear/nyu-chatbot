Q: I am currently an F-1 student in the United States but would like to take classes at NYU over the summer. Am I required to transfer my SEVIS record? A: If you are currently in the US in F-1 status and will participate in a short-term summer program at NYU but return to the school listed on your I-20 for the fall semester, it is possible you do not need to transfer your record to us. We recommend that you first contact your current F-1 sponsor to verify that you may pursue summer study at NYU while maintaining your current F-1 record. You may also [contact us](https://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us.html) if you have questions about whether you should transfer your record to NYU to participate in a short-term summer program.
