Q: Is there an option to expedite the processing of my OPT application? A: [Current processing times](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) are always posted by USCIS. You can check what the current processing time is by clicking on the link, selecting "I-765 for Employment Authorization" for the Form field, "Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]" for the Form Category field, and "Potomac Service Center" for the Field Office or Service Center field. It is best to plan ahead and apply as early as possible because the US government rarely expedites applications (see [USCIS expedite criteria](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/expedite-criteria)) unless you pay an extra cost for premium processing. Please note, there is a significant fee for premium processing (in addition to the OPT application fee). Full details on how to request premium (or expedited) processing is on the USCIS webpage for the [Form I-907](https://www.uscis.gov/i-907), the form needed to request premium processing. It's helpful to cross reference the current processing times tool linked above if and when you apply for OPT to determine whether the extra premium processing fee is worth the significant added expense.
