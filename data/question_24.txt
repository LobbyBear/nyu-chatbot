Q: How can my dependents (spouse and children) come with me to the US? A: If you wish to bring a spouse and/or children under the age of 21 with you, please review our information on [bringing a family member](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/international-spouses-partners-and-families-students/bring-family.html) and include the additional documentation with your I-20/DS-2019 application. Only a spouse and/or children under the age of 21 can accompany you as a dependent. Parents, grandparents, and other relatives are not eligible to come to the US with you as your F-2 or J-2 dependent.
