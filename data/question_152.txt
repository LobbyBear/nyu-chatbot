Q: I was not able to attend a tax workshop. How can I get the information I need? A: Please use the [tax software resources](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/tax.html) on our website that we have made available to you. Sprintax is provided free of charge to the NYU community for help with federal tax filing and at a discounted rate if you are filing your state taxes. Note, you muse use an NYU email address.
