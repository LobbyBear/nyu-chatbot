Q: If I don’t provide arrest information on the visa application, will embassy staff be able to find out whether I’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime? A: Yes, they will most likely have access to this information through other sources. You should never give a false answer to this question on the visa application or in the visa interview. Providing false information on a visa application or during an interview could result in a finding of fraud. A finding of fraud could result in a permanent bar from entering the US.
