Q: How do I receive a refund for taxes withheld in error? A: If you worked for NYU, email [nyu.glacier@nyu.edu](https://www.nyu.edumailto:nyu.glacier@nyu.edu) to request a refund of the taxes withheld. If you work elsewhere, you can contact the employer who withheld the taxes and ask for a refund. If you are unable to get a full refund from your employer use the FAQ or Help feature on the Sprintax software for further instructions. You would need to file the IRS Form 843 and Form 8316 along with supporting documentation as listed on the IRS website for ‘[Refund of Taxes Withheld in Error](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/social-security-tax-medicare-tax-and-self-employment).’
