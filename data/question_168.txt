Q: Will an arrest or conviction cause me to lose my legal status while in the US? A: We are required by law to report, within 21 days, “any disciplinary action taken by the school against the student as a result of the student being convicted of a crime.” This reporting action by itself does not automatically result in a termination of status. However, the information will be available to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who will determine whether additional action is warranted. Additionally, if the disciplinary action is school suspension or expulsion, this may result in a loss of status for not maintaining full-time enrollment.  An arrest or conviction that does not result in a disciplinary action by NYU may still be reported by law enforcement officials to ICE; in which case, ICE officials would have the same discretion to determine whether additional action is warranted.
