Q: I heard I need health insurance coverage as an international student, how does that work, and can I waive it? A: Most students in F-1 and J-1 status are automatically enrolled in and billed for the NYU-sponsored student health insurance comprehensive plan upon registration each semester. F-1 and J-1 students may elect to instead take the basic coverage, which provides more limited coverage, or waive coverage if they are able to secure coverage that meets the University's criteria. More information about health insurance can be found on theÂ [Required Health Insurance page of the OGS website](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/when-you-arrive/required-health-insurance-coverage.html).
