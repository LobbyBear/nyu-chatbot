Q: Can an arrest or conviction affect any other types of immigration applications? A: You should assume that any application you file for an immigration benefit will involve a check for any arrest or criminal history. Extensive databases are maintained at the national level and are available to immigration authorities. You should consult with an immigration attorney about any history of arrest or conviction that may be of concern.
