Q: I am a Canadian citizen preparing my yearly Canadian tax forms and I need NYU to provide me the TL-11A form. A: Upon request, NYU’s Bursar Office is able to prepare and issue the Canadian Tax Form [TL-11A ](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/tl11a.html)(Tuition, Education, and Textbook Amounts Certificate - University Outside Canada). This form will verify any tuition charges, payments, scholarships and financial aid information for the requested tax year. To request this form, contact the [Bursar’s Office](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/contact-us.html) or visit one of the [StudentLink Centers](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-centers-and-spaces/studentlink-center.html).
