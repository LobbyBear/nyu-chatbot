Q: What do I do if the embassy keeps postponing or canceling my visa appointment? A: Unfortunately, you will have to wait until the embassy or consulate you intend to apply at resumes their services in order to go through your visa appointment. Keep checking on the website of the consulate or embassy you plan to apply at for the latest updates. Depending on your situation, you may be eligible for an emergency visa appointment. At many embassies, if you are a student or exchange visitor and your program will begin within 60 days when no regular appointments are available, you may be eligible. You must show them proof that your start date is within 60 days and you must not have had a visa denial within the last 6 months at the US Embassy or Consulate. The website of the embassy or consulate you will apply at will have the detailed information for that location.
