Q: If I defer the start of my academic program, will my SEVIS ID number change? Will I have to apply for a new DS-160 and pay the SEVIS fee again? A: If you inform us of this change by [submitting your US entry plan information](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/plan-your-trip/submit-your-us-entry-plan-information.html) within 30 days of the semester start, then in most cases your SEVIS ID will remain the same.Â You will need to contact the US consulate you plan to apply at to see if you will need to make subsequent changes to your DS-160. If you are deferring beyond one semester, SEVIS does not provide the functionality to defer your start date more than one year into the future. You will need to [apply for a new I-20/DS-2019](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/newly-admitted/before-you-arrive/get-a-us-visa/apply-for-an-i20-or-ds2019.html) no later than 3-4 months before your new program start date, therefore you will then have a new SEVIS ID number. Please note that your SEVIS fee payment is only valid for one year from the date when it was paid. If you do not apply for your visa or request that your SEVIS fee payment be transferred to your new SEVIS ID (if you were issued a new I-20 with new SEVIS ID) within that year, you will need to make a new SEVIS fee payment.
