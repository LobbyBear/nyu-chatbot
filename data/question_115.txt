Q: What kind of job can I take on OPT? A: Your job should be directly related to your NYU major. In other words, you must be able to make a strong connection between your job and what you studied at NYU. If you canâ€™t make that connection, then you should not be working at that job for OPT. Often a job posting or advertisement will include the kinds of degrees the employer believes will be well suited to the advertised position. Having a copy of that job ad is helpful for your documentation that the job is connected to what you studied. You can also get a letter from your job supervisor indicating how your degree is essential for your position. It helps to keep copies of these documents so that if the US government ever wanted to see proof of how you were keeping your status legal while on OPT, you would have easy and ready proof to provide to them. You can also review [the government's policy guidance on OPT](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/opt_policy_guidance_042010.pdf).
