Q: I'm in my last semester and have applied for OPT. Can I be outside the US while it's pending? Is there anything else I should know? A: Yes, you can be outside of the US while your OPT application is pending with USCIS, but there are always risks associated with this. First, we recommend that you have someone you know and trust monitor your mail in the US if you choose to travel. If you receive any correspondence from USCIS while your OPT application is pending, you need to know what they have sent you. On occasion students receive requests for further information/evidence (also known as an “RFE”) from USCIS regarding their application. You must reply to USCIS within a specified period of time if you receive an RFE. If you do not reply to them by their specified deadline, your application would then be at risk for being denied. If the denial occurs when you are outside of the US, then you would be unable to reapply for OPT until and unless you enter back into the US in F-1 status. Additionally, if you are outside of the US after you complete your program but do not have all of the [required travel documents for while you are on OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/travel/documents-to-carry.html), you may face difficulties in reentering the US. Because international travel and restrictions are unpredictable during this time, even if you plan to travel back to the US before your program ends, you may not be able to do so.
