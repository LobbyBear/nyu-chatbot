Q: Can I work in the United States during or after I complete my program? A: F-1 students attending a short-term program in the United States generally cannot obtain work authorization in the United States because F-1 status must be maintained for two full consecutive semesters before students are eligible. J-1 students participating in a short-term exchange or visiting program may be eligible for a special type of work authorization known as [Academic Training](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/off-campus-employment/academic-training.html). Please reach out to your NYU program administrator and OGS to learn more about this option.
