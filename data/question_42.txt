Q: How do I register for classes? A: To register for classes, make an appointment to see your academic advisor in person. Graduate students should go to their department, undergraduate students should go to the advising center for their schools. After meeting your advisor and being cleared, you can register for classes. Use your NYU net ID to register in Albert. Albert is accessed through your [NYUHome](http://home.nyu.edu) account after logging in. After logging into your account, click on the "Academics" tab in the upper left-hand corner and log into Albert to register. To register in Albert you must enter a US or international mobile phone number and emergency contact number in the system. NYU must be able to reach you in an emergency situation. NYU alerts are sent through a text message with instructions or notification about closures. If a mobile phone "emergency contact" number is not listed, you will NOT be able to register. Send an email to [registration@nyu.edu](https://www.nyu.edumailto:registration@nyu.edu) to indicate that you don't have a mobile phone number to provide if you don't yet have a mobile phone. Once you do have a number, you must enter it in Albert. If you have questions about registration, contact the [Office of the University Registrar](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation.html).
