Q: Can my domestic partner come with me to the US? A: Domestic partners can apply for a [B-1/B-2 visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visitor.html) to accompany you. Though B-2 visas are normally for a short duration, it is possible for your partner to accompany you for the duration of your academic program in the US. Your partner would need to demonstrate their intent to depart the US at the conclusion of your stay.
