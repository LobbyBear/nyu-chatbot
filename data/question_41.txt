Q: What's the effect of arrest on my immigration status? A: Wondering what kind of effect an arrest could have on your visa for or legal status within the US? US visa and other Government-Related application forms ask whether you have ever been arrested. It’s important for you to answer this question honestly, but also be aware of what impact this will then have on your application. Remember, if you have been arrested or have had any interaction with the police, inform the OGS immediately. If you ever find yourself arrested or charged with a crime, we recommend that you find two attorneys: one who specializes in immigration law and one who specializes in criminal law.
