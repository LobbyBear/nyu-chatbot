Q: Which date should I select for the start date? A: It is important to carefully select the dates you request for your OPT because you will not be able to change these dates after you apply. If you are applying for [pre-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PreCompletionOPT.html), you should select the date that is your desired start date of employment. Keep in mind that it can take up to 3 months before you will be able to start working. If you are applying for [post-completion OPT](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/current-students/employment-and-tax/optional-practical-training/PostCompletionOPT.html), your start date should be one to sixty days after your completion date. For example, if your completion date is May 20, your OPT can start anywhere from May 21 at the earliest and July 18 at the latest. However, if you think it will be challenging to find a job, you should select a later start date to ensure you do not waste your OPT time. Keep in mind if you find a job before this date, you wonâ€™t be able to start working until you have the EAD card in hand and the OPT period has begun.
