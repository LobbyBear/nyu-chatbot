Q: What should I do if I did not file or am unable to file my tax forms by the deadline? A: You should try your best to submit your tax form(s) by the deadline. If you had taxable income and are unable to file your forms by the deadline, you will need to mail a [Form 4868 Automatic Extension of Time to File your Tax Return](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4868.pdf) to the IRS by the tax filing deadline. Your application requesting the automatic extension will also need to be postmarked by the United States Post Office by the deadline. Several US Post Offices remain open for extended hours on the tax filing deadline date. On the form, you will need to properly estimate your tax liability for the year, which is why we prefer you just submit the tax form that Glacier Tax Prep provides to you instead. If you did not have any taxable income in the previous year, you have until June 15 to submit the Form 8843.
