Q: Can I waive the NYU student health insurance? A: F-1 and J-1 students are automatically charged for the comprehensive insurance plan through NYU. If you have your own health insurance and do not want the NYU plan, you must apply for a waiver online. Your plan must meet or exceed the coverage provided by NYUâ€™s plan.
