Q: What should I do if I worked in the US and did not receive or lost my Form W-2? A: Contact the employer(s) you worked for and request that another copy of your Form W-2 be mailed to you. Be sure that they have your correct address on file. Ask your employer(s) if you are able to access your Form W-2 online. Students or scholars who were employed at NYU may follow [these instructions](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/financelink/payroll/form-w-2.html) to access the Form W-2 online. If you have requested the Form W-2 from your employer but have not received it, the IRS can help you obtain the missing form(s). Call 1-800-829-1040. Be prepared to provide your name, address (including zip code), phone number, Social Security Number, and dates of employment and the name, address (including zip code), and phone number of the employer.
