Q: When is the deadline to file my tax forms? A: The deadline to file your tax forms for individuals who had taxable income during the previous tax year is typically April 15. If April 15 falls on a weekend or government holiday, the IRS will post the deadline on their website. Confirm the deadline for the state(s) you will need to file taxes in. Some states have extended the deadline to be consistent with the federal deadline whereas others are keeping with the April 15 deadline. For people who did not receive US income and are only filing IRS Form 8843, the deadline is June 15.Â  Please note that the deadline refers to the date the envelope is postmarked by the post office. Some post offices remain open until midnight on the day of the deadline. Students and scholars can also submit their federal taxes electronically (via E-filing) with the Sprintax software. Electronic filing is not permitted for state taxes.
