Q: I will be completing my STEM OPT soon. I am concerned that I will not be able to leave the United States before my 60 day grace period ends. What options exist for me? A: Students in F-1 status who have not yet accrued 150 days of unemployment during the post-completion and STEM OPT time period have up to sixty days after their STEM OPT end date to remain legally in the United States. This sixty days is also referred to as your “grace period.” If, however, you wish to see if you can extend your time in the United States even further, one option would be the cap gap extension. If you are currently on STEM OPT and you have an employer interested in sponsoring you for an H-1B work visa, you may be eligible to apply for a [Cap Gap Extension](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/alumni/extend-your-opt/cap-gap-extension.html). If this option is not possible for you, we encourage you to [schedule an online advising appointment](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-visa-and-immigration/contact-us/schedule-online-appointment-ogs-advisor.html) to discuss whether changing from F-1 to another status in the United States may be a viable option for you.
