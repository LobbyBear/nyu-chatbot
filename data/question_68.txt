Q: Is there anything I should do once I arrive in the United States? A: The US government requires all international students in F-1 and J-1 status to report their arrival to their schools. You officially report your arrival to NYU through [the OGS arrival form.](https://ogsonline.ogs.nyu.edu/istart/controllers/client/ClientEngine.cfm?serviceid=EFormGroupProvider&eformGroup=39) You should do this immediately after arriving in the United States, especially if your short-term program is less than one week. Special note for visiting non-degree summer students: you may have a specialized check-in coordinated by your academic program. If this applies to you, please follow the instructions provided by your program to attend the OGS check-in. If you have not received instructions to attend an in-person check in, please submit [the OGS arrival form](https://ogsonline.ogs.nyu.edu/istart/controllers/client/ClientEngine.cfm?serviceid=EFormGroupProvider&eformGroup=39) to complete your immigration requirements.
