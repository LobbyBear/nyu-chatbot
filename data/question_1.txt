Q: When should I apply for the I-20/DS-2019? A: Submit your application at least 3-4  months prior to your intended start date in case of visa delays. If you don’t apply at least 3-4 months prior to your intended start date you may face difficulty in arriving for the first day of classes if you are outside the US, but OGS will continue to accept applications beyond this time.
