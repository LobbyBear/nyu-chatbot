Q: I completed an eligible STEM degree and am self-employed. Am I eligible for the STEM OPT extension? A: No, the regulations for the 24-month extension require that students have an employer/employee relationship. Students cannot sign the Form I-983 as both the employer and the employee. If you are working for a start-up company you may be eligible if the company is enrolled in e-verify and there is someone else in the company who is your employer and can complete all of the necessary confirmations on the Form I-983.
